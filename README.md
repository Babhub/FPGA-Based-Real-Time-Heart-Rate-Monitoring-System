# FPGA-Based-Real-Time-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-System
The project aims to develop an FPGA-based real-time heart rate monitoring system. It processes PPG/ECG sensor signals, filters noise, calculates BPM, and displays results on a 7-segment display or LED. Implemented using Vivado and VHDL, it ensures fast, efficient heart rate detection using DSP techniques.
